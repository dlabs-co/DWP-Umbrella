/*
 *  OpenGarden sensor platform for Arduino from Cooking-hacks.
 *
 *  Description: Open Garden is a Arduino based platform, which 
 *  communicates with a wireless network of nodes to gather information
 *  about the necessary parameters for the care of a garden, a group
 *  of plants or hydroponics cultures and including actuators required
 *  to improve these parameters. 
 *
 *  In this example we use a DHT22 to read air humidity. 
 *  It returns a float value of the percentage of relative humidity.
